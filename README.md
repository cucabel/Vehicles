# Vehicles

We want to do a software for a cars' garage, that at this moment has motorbikes and cars. Cars always will have
four wheels, and motorbikes, two.

Phase 1:
We are asked to create a main class that does the next steps:
1) Ask to the user for the license number, brand and color of its car.
2) Create the car with the last data.
3) Add two wheels at the back, after asking for their brand and diameter to the user
4) Add two wheels to the front, after asking for their brand and diameter to the user

Phase 2:
Improve the previous code, verifying the needed information to create the objects.
- the license number must have four numbers and two or three letters
- wheel's diameter has to be grater than 0.4 and smaller than 4

Phase 3:
Modify the last project adding the needed methods to a Bike, so wheels can be added on the front and the back
Modify the last main, adding the option of bike or car
0) Ask the user if it wants to create a car or a bike
1) ask to the user for the license number, brand and color
2) create the vehicle with the previous data
3) add the corresponding back wheels, asking to the user for the brand and diameter
4) add the corresponding front wheels, asking to the user for the brand and diameter
